Todos:
- [ ] (from Jim's) give each dot a color, probably on a gradient
- [ ] (from Jim's) make each dot flash white as it passes the line
- [ ] (bug) on the 4 octave chromatic config the smallest 2 dots look misaligned
- [ ] (bug) address the background droning noise somehow, seeming to come from multiple notes in our synthesizer playing together
- [ ] punch up visual style (button styling, padding)

Looser thoughts:
- [ ] flash the note being played ("C#") as that tone passes the line
- [ ] make everything that goes into a ScenarioConfig editable by the user
